google-shortcut-extension
=========================

A chrome extension to add keyboard shortcuts to Google Search Results.

A nifty hack that helps users open multiple search results in new tabs by using keyboard shortcuts.

After installing the extension, your Google search result page should look like this.

Next to every results, corresponding numbers should appear. When those keys are pressed on the keyboard, the same shall open in the same/new tab (depending on the configured settings on the option page).
